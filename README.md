# Macaw
Bitmap creation and editing library.

## README
Macaw is a library which combines multiple image processing libraries to create an easy to use programtic image manipulation toolkit. The combined libraries enable replication of the common processes available in most image editing applications. The libraries Accord and Dynamic Image allow for the transformation, cropping, and resizing of images. These libraries also enable pixel and channel editing as well as the applications of bitmap filters. Bitmaps can be layered with transparency options through the Dynamic Image library. 
A range of data can be extracted from the images including pixel color values and channels. Vector information can be extracted from bitmaps through the Potrace library and select application of Accord's imaging library which also allow for basic shape and figure detection. 
Bitmaps can also be created though proceedural processes including noise and cellular from the Fast Noise Library.
